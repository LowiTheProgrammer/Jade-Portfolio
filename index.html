        <h1>WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO</h1>
        <img src="jade.png" alt="Profile" class="profile-img">
        <p>HI THERE!, I AM MYCHO, A WORKING STUDENT, AND ALSO A GYMRAT. I AM AN 18-YEAR-OLD FROM DAY-AS, CORDOVA, CEBU, AND THE ELDEST AMONG MY SIBLINGS. AS A WORKING STUDENT, I’VE LEARNED TO BALANCE MY RESPONSIBILITIES AT SCHOOL AND AT WORK, DEVELOPING BOTH DISCIPLINE AND DETERMINATION. I ALSO DEDICATE TIME TO WORKING OUT, WHICH KEEPS ME STRONG, FOCUSED, AND MOTIVATED TO PUSH MYSELF TOWARD MY GOALS IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE.

        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        </div>
        <p>
            I AM CURRENTLY WORKING AT MCDONALDS CORDOVA, AND IT HAS BEEN 6 MONTHS SINCE IVE STARTED, 
            IT IS BEEN QUITE CHALLENGING, ESPECIALLY WHEN I MOVED TO THE STATION OF BEING A CASHIER, 
            REFUND, COMPLAINS, YOU NAME IT, BUT I BELIEVE THAT ESCAPING IN YOUR COMFORT ZONE IS THE ONLY 
            WAY FOR ME TO GROW AND IMPROVE MYSELF.

        </div>
        <p>
            BEING A WORKING STUDENT WHO ALSO TRAINS SIX TIMES A WEEK SHOWS MY DEDICATION, RESILIENCE, AND 
            ABILITY TO BALANCE DEMANDING PRIORITIES. MY DAYS ARE OFTEN PACKED — JUGGLING CLASSES, ASSIGNMENTS, 
            AND WORK SHIFTS — YET I STILL MAKE TIME TO HIT THE GYM CONSISTENTLY, PUSHING MYSELF PHYSICALLY AS 
            MUCH AS I DO MENTALLY. THIS DISCIPLINE NOT ONLY BUILDS MY STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE BUT ALSO SHARPENS 
            MY FOCUS, TIME MANAGEMENT, AND STRESS-HANDLING SKILLS. WHILE THE SCHEDULE CAN BE EXHAUSTING, IT FUELS 
            MY PERSONAL GROWTH, PROVING THAT WITH DETERMINATION AND CONSISTENCY, I CAN ACHIEVE BOTH ACADEMIC AND 
            FITNESS GOALS WITHOUT COMPROMISING EITHER.
